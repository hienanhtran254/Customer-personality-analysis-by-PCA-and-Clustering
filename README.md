## 1. Background: 
This report aims to explore the dataset from customer-personality.csv to help a company understand their customers' behaviour.
## 2. Methodologies: 
For understanding customer personality and delivering a proper marketing strategy, we would choose dimension reduction method. It helps remove multicollinearity which improves the interpretation of the parameters of the machine learning model. To complete the final customer profiling, we applied both supervised and unsupervised learning.
